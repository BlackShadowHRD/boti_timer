## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
### All Modes
The timer is controlled by typing commands into the chat or the server console. Vanilla behaviour is, that only server operators are allowed to use the `/function` command so other players are not able to start/pause etc. the timer.

| Action | Command |
|-----------|--------------|
| initialise the timer | `/function boti_timer:init` |
| start the timer | `/function boti_timer:start` |
| pause the timer | `/function boti_timer:pause` |
| reset the timer | `/function boti_timer:reset` |
| resume the timer | `/function boti_timer:resume` |

### Countdown Mode
The countdown mode comes with 4 presets, for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour respectively. It can also be used with a custom period of time, which needs to be specified in seconds.

| Action | Command |
|-----------|--------------|
| initialise the timer | `/function boti_timer:settings/preset/5m` |
| start the timer | `/function boti_timer:settings/preset/15m` |
| pause the timer | `/function boti_timer:settings/preset/30m` |
| reset the timer | `/function boti_timer:settings/preset/1h` |
| resume the timer | `/function boti_timer:resume` |

When using the preset countdowns the timer has to be started manually by issuing the following command: `/function boti_timer:start`

When a different amount of time for the countdown timer is required, this can be done by issuing the comand `/function boti_timer:settings/mode/countdown {secs:nnnn}` where nnnn is the number of seconds required. If the countdown timer is used this way, **it will start immediately**. In the following example the countdown timer will run for 90 minutes:

- `/function boti_timer:settings/mode/countdown {secs:5400}`

> **Note: This will start the countdown immediately.**

## üéÆ Operator Controls

| Function | Description |

| `/function boti_timer:display/enable` | Show timer on actionbar |
| `/function boti_timer:display/disable` | Hide timer display |
| `/function boti_timer:display/toggle` | Toggle show/hide |
